# Lab 5.1 - Starting to play with some artificial neural networks!

## Overview
Make sure you've watched Lecture 13 before starting this lab!

In this lab, you'll start building up small neural networks *by hand*! You'll get to solve some simple problems, and see some of the technical components of how these artificial brains are represented and how you do the computation to process the outputs. 

There are a few problems you should try to get working, with the last one being a bit of a "stretch" goal. In the next lab, we'll expand this code to include populations of brains and start letting evolution do the hard work for us!


## Look at the Jupyter Notebook before moving to code on Repl.it!
It walks you through some technical bits that I ignored for simplicity during the lecture.
